Fast Acquisition Data Stream Archiver
=====================================

Introduction
------------
The FA archiver comprises a suite of tools for acquiring, storing and processing
the Fast Acquisition data stream generated by Libera EBPMs or other data sources
using the Diamond FA communication controller.

The core components of the archiver suite are:

fa_sniffer_
    The Fast Acquisition communication network communicates with the FA archiver
    through a communication controller FPGA firmware image installed on a
    Virtex-5 PCI Express development board, the `LXT ML555`_ development kit.
    The FA sniffer firmware was developed by Isa Uzun at Diamond Light Source.

    With this card installed the fa_sniffer_ device driver provides a buffered
    character device interface to FA data stream allowing the entire data stream
    from up to 255 attached devices to be captured without interruption.  The
    associated data rate is around 20 MB per second.

fa-archiver_
    The archiver software runs on the same machine as the sniffer card and its
    firmware.  The data stream is read continuously and archived in a rolling
    circular archive and simultaneously retransmitted through a socket interface
    to interested clients.

    At Diamond we use a 6TB archive, using two 3TB disks joined into a single
    `/dev/mapper` block device (as the archiver can only archive to a single
    targe file).  This gives us access to just under 4 1/2 days of archive of
    183 FA data sources (both electron BPMs and other sources).

    Live data is available for any of the 255 FA sources at full data rate, or
    at a low pass filtered decimated rate (1/10 rate by default).  Archived data
    is also available at full rate and at two different binned rates (1/64 and
    1/16384 by default), also called decimated -- these are useful for
    generating overviews of the stored data.

fa-prepare_
    The archive file used by the archiver must be prepared before use, in
    particular the set of FA ids to archive and the operating parameters must be
    set.  The fa-prepare tool is used to do this.

The following tools make use of the server interface to the archiver:

fa-viewer_
    The viewer provides a direct view of the live data from a single data
    source, and can display the spectrum and integrated power spectrum.  This
    can be a very powerful diagnostic tool.

fa_zoomer_
    This is a matlab script that interfaces to the archive and provides an
    overview of the entire content of the archive.  Regions of the archived data
    can be zoomed into and viewed at any required level of data.

fa-capture_
    This command line tool interfaces directly to the archive server to capture
    both live and archived data.

fa-audio_
    Occasionally the FA data stream can be instructive as an audio stream.  This
    is particularly successful as the FA data rate of 10kHz is a good match for
    audio.

fa-spectrum_
    This is a tool designed to continuously monitor a limited number of FA
    devices and compute the power spectrum over an extended time.  The resulting
    output is generated as EPICS PVs designed to be saved by the EPICS PV
    archiver.

The following supporting libraries are also worth noting:

falib_
    This is a Python library used in the implementation of the Python tools
    listed above.

fa_load_
    This is a matlab wrapper around the fa-capture tool.
